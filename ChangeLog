0.51 -- As I don't know how to remove 'strict refs', I commented out 
        use strict.
        
0.49 -- Fixed a bug. Makefile.PL should now require Term::Screen::ReadLine
        to be at least version 0.33.

0.48 -- Fixed a bug. The Esc, F1, F3 (previous screen) key should work; 
        also when the validator function returns 'false'.

0.47 -- Added an extra parameter to the VALIDATOR function, namely
        $self. So the wizard is given to the validator function as
        the first argument and the inputted line as the second.

0.46 -- Removed a bug. When the user inputs a password, after the
        user leaves the field, the password isn't starred out.
     -- A validator function has been added to validate a field().
     -- A readonly option has been added to a screen.

0.45 -- Removed a bug. When the wizard was called with specific screens,
        all variables were cleared. This has been corrected.
     -- Removed function get_screen() (this has become an internal 
        function).
     -- Added a function set() to set keywords of a screen, or to set
        values of prompts.

0.41 -- Made some changes to the wizard() and get_keys() functions.
        Extended them with the possibility to ask a number of screens.
        This makes it possible to use a selection of all possible
        screens from the wizard.

0.33 -- Enhanced documentation of wizard() function.
     -- Little bug fix. wizard() function now also returns "next", if
        the last prompt of the wizard() has option NOFINISH set.

0.32 -- Converted all files to UNIX format.

0.31 -- Forgot to include the dependencies in Makefile.PL, added them.

0.30 -- Structured the tests in test.pl
     -- Debugged Wizard.pm according to test results.
     -- Extended Makefile.PL to have dependencies.
     -- Added ChangeLog
